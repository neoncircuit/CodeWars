# Potenciation

## Instructions

Your task is to implement a function that takes two inputs, `x` and `y`, and returns the value of `x` raised to the power of `y`.

Simple, right? But you are NOT allowed to use Math.pow();

Both `x` and `y` will be natural numbers (non-negative integers) in range `0 <= x,y <= 13`.

Special Case: For this challenge, `0^0` is defined to be `1`.

## Given Code
```
function power(x,y){
  //SHOW ME WHAT YOU GOT!
}
```

## My Solution
```
function power(x,y){
  //SHOW ME WHAT YOU GOT!
  return x**y;
}
```
