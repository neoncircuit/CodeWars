# Opposites Attract

Timmy & Sarah think they are in love, but around where they live, they will only know once they pick a flower each. If one of the flowers has an even number of petals and the other has an odd number of petals it means they are in love.

Write a function that will take the number of petals of each flower and return true if they are in love and false if they aren't.

# Given Code

```python
def lovefunc( flower1, flower2 ):
    # ...
```

# My Solution

```python
def lovefunc( flower1: int, flower2: int ) -> bool:
    # ...
    return flower1%2 != flower2%2
```

# Complexity Analysis

**Time Complexity:** O(1)

**Space Complexity:** O(1)

**Explanation:**
**Time: O(1)** - Constant time complexity. The code performs a fixed number of operations regardless of input size. No loops or recursive calls that depend on input size were detected.

**Space: O(1)** - Constant space complexity. The code uses a fixed amount of memory regardless of input size.
