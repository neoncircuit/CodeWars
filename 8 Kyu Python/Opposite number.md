# Opposite number

Very simple, given a number, find its opposite (additive inverse).

Examples:
```
1: -1
14: -14
-34: 34
```

# Given Code

```python
def opposite(number):
  # your solution here
```

# My Solution

```python
def opposite(number: int) -> int:
  # your solution here
    """
    Return the opposite of a given number.

    Args:
        number: int - The input number.

    Returns:
        The inverse of the input number. Eg. -34 returns 34, 1 returns -1, etc.
    """
    return -number
```

# Complexity Analysis

**Time Complexity:** O(1)

**Space Complexity:** O(1)

**Explanation:**
**Time: O(1)** - Constant time complexity. The code performs a fixed number of operations regardless of input size. No loops or recursive calls that depend on input size were detected.

**Space: O(1)** - Constant space complexity. The code uses a fixed amount of memory regardless of input size.
