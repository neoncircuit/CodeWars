# 5 without numbers !!

## Instructions

Write a function that always returns `5`

Sounds easy right? Just bear in mind that you can't use any of the following characters: `0123456789*+-/`

Good luck :)

## Given Code
```python
def unusual_five():
    return 5 # nope !
```

## My Solution
```python
def unusual_five():
    return len("honda") # nope !
```
