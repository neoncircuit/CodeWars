# Student's Final Grade

Create a function `final_grade`, which calculates the final grade of a student depending on two parameters: a grade for the exam and a number of completed projects.

This function should take two arguments: exam - grade for exam (from 0 to 100); projects - number of completed projects (from 0 and above);

This function should return a number (final grade). There are four types of final grades:

- 100, if a grade for the exam is more than 90 or if a number of completed projects more than 10.
- 90, if a grade for the exam is more than 75 and if a number of completed projects is minimum 5.
- 75, if a grade for the exam is more than 50 and if a number of completed projects is minimum 2.
- 0, in other cases

## Examples(Inputs-->Output):
```
100, 12 --> 100
99, 0 --> 100
10, 15 --> 100

85, 5 --> 90

55, 3 --> 75

55, 0 --> 0
20, 2 --> 0
```

# Given Code

```python
def final_grade(exam, projects):
    return # final grade
```

# My Solution

```python
def final_grade(exam: int, projects: int) -> int:
    # final grade
    return 100 if (exam > 90 or projects > 10) \
        else 90 if (exam > 75 and projects >= 5) \
        else 75 if (exam > 50 and projects >= 2) \
        else 0
```

# Complexity Analysis

**Time Complexity:** O(1)

**Space Complexity:** O(1)

**Explanation:**
**Time: O(1)** - Constant time complexity. The code performs a fixed number of operations regardless of input size. No loops or recursive calls that depend on input size were detected.

**Space: O(1)** - Constant space complexity. The code uses a fixed amount of memory regardless of input size.
