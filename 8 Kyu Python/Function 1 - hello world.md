# Function 1 - hello world

Make a simple function called `greet` that returns the most-famous "hello world!".

## Style Points
Sure, this is about as easy as it gets. But how clever can you be to create the most creative "hello world" you can think of? What is a "hello world" solution you would want to show your friends?

# Given Code

def greet() -> str:
    return "hello world!"
```

# Complexity Analysis

**Time Complexity:** O(1)

**Space Complexity:** O(1)

**Explanation:**
**Time: O(1)** - Constant time complexity. The code performs a fixed number of operations regardless of input size. No loops or recursive calls that depend on input size were detected.

**Space: O(1)** - Constant space complexity. The code uses a fixed amount of memory regardless of input size.
