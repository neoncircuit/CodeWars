# Who ate the cookie?

## Instructions

For this problem you must create a program that says who ate the last cookie. If the input is a string then "Zach" ate the cookie. If the input is a float or an int then "Monica" ate the cookie. If the input is anything else "the dog" ate the cookie. The way to return the statement is: "Who ate the last cookie? It was (name)!"

Ex: Input = "hi" --> Output = "Who ate the last cookie? It was Zach! (The reason you return Zach is because the input is a string)

Note: Make sure you return the correct message with correct spaces and punctuation.

Please leave feedback for this kata. Cheers!

## Given Code
```python
def cookie(x):
    pass #Good Luck
```

## My Solution
```python
def cookie(x) -> str:
    #Good Luck
    if isinstance(x, str):
        name = "Zach"
    elif isinstance(x, (int, float)) and not isinstance(x, bool):
        name = "Monica"
    else:
        name = "the dog"
    return f"Who ate the last cookie? It was {name}!"
```
