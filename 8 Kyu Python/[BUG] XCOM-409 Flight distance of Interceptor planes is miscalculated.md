# [BUG] XCOM-409: Flight distance of Interceptor planes is miscalculated

You are an intern working in the software development department of the X-COM agency, responsible for fighting off a large-scale invasion of extraterrestrials. Your task for today is described with the bug report below:

## [BUG] XCOM-409: Flight distance of Interceptor planes is miscalculated
**Type**: Bug 🪳

**Priority**: Major

**Component**: Operational Logistics Software

**Reporter**: `maverick`

**Assignee**: _Assigned to you_

## Bug Description
Pilots have reported discrepancies in their flight logs after returning from interception missions. The **travel distance** logged in the logistics software does not match actual flight paths, potentially leading to incorrect fuel calculations and errors in planning of future missions.

## Steps to Reproduce
1. Deploy an interceptor to engage a UFO.
2. Upon its return, note the average speed (given in **knots**) and travel time (in **minutes**) reported by onboard instruments.
3. Enter the values into the Logistics and Planning System.
4. Expected result: The system should correctly compute the **distance in kilometers**.
5. Actual result: The logged distance appears **inaccurate**.

## Impact
If not fixed, this could cause interceptors to run out of fuel mid-mission, leaving Earth vulnerable to alien attacks. On the other hand, if the system **overestimates travel distance**, interceptors may be **overfueled**, making them heavier than necessary. This reduces **maneuverability**, increases takeoff time, and could put pilots at a disadvantage during high-speed engagements with alien craft.

The Flight Operations team has requested an immediate fix.

## Task
Investigate and fix the bug in the travel distance calculation function.

Once this ticket is resolved, you can pick another open ticket from the backlog.

# Given Code

```python
# speed of aircrafts is given in *knots*
# travelTime is in *minutes*
# travel distance should be returned in *kilometers*

def travel_distance(avg_speed, travel_time):
    KM_PER_MILE = 1.609344
    travel_hours = travel_time / 60
    travel_miles = avg_speed * travel_hours
    travel_kms = travel_miles / KM_PER_MILE
    return travel_kms
```

# My Solution

```python
# speed of aircrafts is given in *knots*
# travelTime is in *minutes*
# travel distance should be returned in *kilometers*

def travel_distance(avg_speed: int, travel_time: int) -> float:
    """
    Calculates flight distance in Kilometers based on speed in Knots 
    and time in Minutes.
    
    Distance traveled = avg_speed * travel_hours * KM_PER_NAUT_MILE
    
    args:
        avg_speed: int
        travel_time: int
    returns:
        travel_kms: float
    """
    # 1 Nautical Mile = 1.852 Kilometers
    KM_PER_NAUT_MILE = 1.852 
    travel_hours = travel_time / 60
    travel_miles = avg_speed * travel_hours
    travel_kms = travel_miles * KM_PER_NAUT_MILE
    return round(travel_kms, 1)
```
