# Pythagorean Triple

## Instructions

Given an unsorted array of 3 positive integers `[ n1, n2, n3 ]`, determine if it is possible to form a Pythagorean Triple using those 3 integers.

A Pythagorean Triple consists of arranging 3 integers, such that:

**a2 + b2 = c2**

## Examples

[5, 3, 4] : it is possible to form a Pythagorean Triple using these 3 integers: 32 + 42 = 52

[3, 4, 5] : it is possible to form a Pythagorean Triple using these 3 integers: 32 + 42 = 52

[13, 12, 5] : it is possible to form a Pythagorean Triple using these 3 integers: 52 + 122 = 132

[100, 3, 999] : it is NOT possible to form a Pythagorean Triple using these 3 integers - no matter how you arrange them, you will never find a way to satisfy the equation a2 + b2 = c2

## Return Values

- For Python: return `True` or `False`

- For JavaScript: return `true` or `false`

- Other languages: return `1` or `0` or refer to Sample Tests.


## Given Code
```python
# input is an unsorted list of 3 positive integers
def pythagorean_triple(integers):
    # return True if it is possible to form a Pythagorean triple with the 3 integers
    # return False if it is not possible
    pass
```

## My Solution
```python
# input is an unsorted list of 3 positive integers
def pythagorean_triple(integers):
    # return True if it is possible to form a Pythagorean triple with the 3 integers
    # return False if it is not possible
    a, b, c = sorted(integers)
    return a**2 + b**2 == c**2
```
