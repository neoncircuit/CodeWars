# Duplicate Encoder

The goal of this exercise is to convert a string to a new string where each character in the new string is ```"("``` if that character appears only once in the original string, or ```")"``` if that character appears more than once in the original string. Ignore capitalization when determining if a character is a duplicate.

## Examples
```
"din"      =>  "((("
"recede"   =>  "()()()"
"Success"  =>  ")())())"
"(( @"     =>  "))((" 
```

Notes
Assertion messages may be unclear about what they display in some languages. If you read ```"...It Should encode XXX"```, the ```"XXX"``` is the expected result, not the input!



# Given Code

```{python}
def duplicate_encode(word):
    #your code here
```

# My Solution

```{python}
def duplicate_encode(word):
    #your code here
    word = word.lower()
    wordDict = {}
    res = ""
    for i in word:
        if i in wordDict:
            wordDict[i] += 1
        else:
            wordDict[i] = 1
    
    for j in word:
        if wordDict[j] == 1:
            res += "("
        else:
            res += ")"
    return res
```
