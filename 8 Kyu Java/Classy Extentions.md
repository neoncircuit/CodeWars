# Classy Extentions

## Instructions

The goal of this kata is to train the basic OOP concepts of inheritance and method overriding.

You will be preloaded with the `Animal` class, so you should only edit the `Cat` class.

## Task

Your task is to complete the `Cat` class which extends `Animal` and replace the `speak` method to return the cats name + meows. e.g. `'Mr Whiskers meows.'`

The name attribute is accessible in the class with `this.name`.

Reference: Oracle docs

## Given Code
```
public class Cat extends Animal {
  public Cat(String name) {
    super(name);
  }
  
  // your code here
}
```

## My Solution
```
public class Cat extends Animal {
  public Cat(String name) {
    super(name);
  }
  
  @Override
  public String speak() {
    return this.name + " meows.";
  }
}
```
