# Disemvowel Trolls

Trolls are attacking your comment section!

A common way to deal with this situation is to remove all of the vowels from the trolls' comments, neutralizing the threat.

Your task is to write a function that takes a string and return a new string with all vowels removed.

For example, the string "This website is for losers LOL!" would become "Ths wbst s fr lsrs LL!".

Note: for this kata `y` isn't considered a vowel.

# Given Code

```python
def disemvowel(string_):
    return string_
```

# My Solution

```python
def disemvowel(string_: str) -> str:
    vowels = set("aeiouAEIOU")
    return ''.join(char for char in string_ if char not in vowels)
```

# Complexity Analysis

**Time Complexity:** O(n)

**Space Complexity:** O(n)

**Explanation:**
**Time: O(n)** - Linear time complexity. The code iterates through the input once (using loops like for, while, forEach, map, filter, reduce). The number of operations grows proportionally with the input size.

**Space: O(n)** - Linear space complexity. Data structures (arrays, objects, sets, maps) were detected that may grow proportionally with input size.
